# More or Less Less is More

"More or Less Less is More" is a strategic game where players select buttons on a grid to accumulate a sum as close as possible to a target value. Each move is determined by the value of the previously selected button, and the game ends when the move counter reaches zero.


## Features

- **Randomized Grid**: Each game starts with a randomly generated grid of numbers.
- **Target Value**: A target value is displayed above the grid.
- **Move Counter**: The number of moves left is displayed above the grid.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Players can only select buttons based on the value of the previously selected button.
- **End Game**: The game ends when the move counter reaches zero, and the final sum is compared to the target value.
